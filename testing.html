          <p class="">Though the app is made specifically for the Epson Moverio Smart Glasses, the client was keen for it to also be able to be used on any Android enabled devise, such as Samsung Galaxy Smart phone or Android tablet, using such a devises inbuilt camera. </p>
          <p class="">We were careful throughout the design process for both prototypes to consider this. We first tested Android compatibility using an Android emulator on a PC, which proved successful, and then on an Android enabled smart phone. Both prototypes performed well on the smart phone, which could be held up in front of objects, which were detected by the camera and the expected text labelling the item appeared on the screen. The response rate was quicker on Prototype One, which a more 3D style of text which followed the image of the object around on screen in a satisfying way. The response rate was slightly slower with the Final Prototype, but still displayed very clearly but with text remaining at the top of the screen. The Final Prototype also had the advantage of coming with an inbuilt library of pre-programmed everyday objects it can recognise, so is more versatile. </p>
          <p class="">In conclusion our prototype apps work just as well on the Epson Smart Glasses as on any Android devises, so successfully fulfil this requirement. </p>

          <h1 class="text-center text-secondary"><b>User Acceptance Testing&nbsp;</b></h1>
          <p class="">By recruiting volunteer testers from willing members of family and friends we used user acceptance testing to assess user requirements, analyse ease of use and gain valuable feedback from our wide range of testers to help us evaluate our product. We did this at two stages: firstly whilst the app was still being developed: Alpha Testing, and (with largely the same sample of volunteers) after completion: Beta Testing </p>
          <p class=""><b>How the tests were carried out</b>: We set up a situation involving a table containing a selection of objects, including the 4 sample medical items that we bought for the purpose: the blood pressure monitor, pulse oximeter, otoscope and IR Thermometer, which the app had been programmed to recognise and identify (which most of the testers were fairly unfamiliar with), along with a few common household items, which differing versions of the app may also be able to understand. Our testers were, one at a time, given the glasses, and sometimes also an android smart phone, with the app working on it and were asked to find among the objects on the table certain items, to pick them up to examine them, moving the object around to see how well the corresponding text label displayed near it. They each had a go at using the other features such as voice recognition and referencing PDF (though at the Alpha stage and tests performed with the first prototype this was not applicable they were not yet implemented). They were then given a questionnaire and asked to rate different aspects of usability and jot down any comments and feedback they could give us to help assess our progress, identify areas to be improved and understand where our strengths and weaknesses lied.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

          <h2 class="text-left text-dark"><b>Alpha test for prototype #1:</b></h2>
          <p class="">Though the testers found the app easy to use and all agreed that the text displayed well, they all also agreed that it had too many limitations. The style of the writing on the screen was very well liked, several people commented that it looked 3D, like good quality AR as if hovering just above the item, so it was clear what it referred it. However the ends of the text had a tendency to disappear off the edge of the screen as the user looked around wearing the glasses. Comments were positive about the way the text followed the item around when it was picked up and moved around by hand, getting bigger closer to the camera, just as the object did. Highly ranked for style! At this stage the app could only recognise two of the medical items and the user needed to switch between them, making a small image of each item display in the corner of the screen, which was generally agreed to look good but be impractical and take up too much space, cluttering vision. It was also agreed to be too limiting in that the Moverio SDK used for programming, though offering a good response rate, clear AR and option for 2D overlay mode, could only be programmed for up to 5 objects and identify no more than 3 in one view, which was considered not good enough for our purposes. It would also prove too hard for additional items to be added to a back end database as they were modelled by a method of photogrammetry which would be hard and time consuming for the general public to do themselves.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2 class="text-left text-dark"><b>Alpha Test for Final Prototype:</b></h2>
          <p class="">It was well liked and positively commented on that the app could, in this form (programmed using Fritz) identify a much wider range of objects and was pre-programmed to respond to different household objects. Response rate was deemed to be too slow. Most people commented that it took a long time to show text and words lingered on the screen after the item was no longer in view. The text was agreed to be clear, easy to read, with no letters missed off (as had been a problem with prototype #1). Other features had not yet been included, so many people commented that it was very basic and had suggestions of features to be added to increase usefulness and functionality.</p>
          <h2 class="text-left text-dark"><b>Beta Test for Final Prototype:</b></h2>
          <p class="">Our testers were generally impressed at the range of objects recognised, but it was still thought to have a slower than ideal response rate, with text lingering too long and not responding sooner to new items being seen. The style of writing was deemed to be clear and easy to read, though text which followed the item around rather than remain static in the top corner of the screen as preferred. The home-screen and user interface was generally positively commented on, with suggestions for improvements. It was agreed that it worked just as well with the hand-held android devise (smart phone), which was well liked to be a versatile feature as most people donâ€™t have access to smart glasses. They liked the voice recognition feature but many commented that it should be expanded to respond to more detailed instructions. There were positive comments for the PDF display function, which people reported as finding easy to use, scrolling with the hand held mouse to advance pages and pressing the back button on the controller to return to the main screen. </p>
