          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2"><b>&nbsp;User interface / user experience&nbsp;</b></h2>
          <p class="">The experience the user has when using the app is a relatively straightforward and uncomplicated experience. There are very minimal menus in the app and clear instructions on how to navigate the application. Mostly the programme works automatically upon being switched on, which users find convenient and simple to use. The only options the user much say are 'next' after the instructions are shown, 'yes/no' when an object is detected and 'back' when they want to exit the pdf viewer. These are well documented in the app and make transitioning in the app quite seamless.</p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2"><b>Functionality</b></h2>
          <p class="">The app serves its basic principle of identifying custom objects and loading instructions. However the response rate could be a lot better. The text on the final prototype is displayed at the top of the screen rather than directly above the object, which would have been preferable. </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2"><b>Stability</b></h2>
          <p class="">The app generally feels quite stable, we have had little to no trouble concerning stability, in testing it did not crash significantly, so it can be rated with a good level of stability. </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2"><b>Efficiency</b></h2>
          <p class="">The app does what it is intended to do with minimal distractions and complications. </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2"><b>Compatibility</b></h2>
          <p class="">The app is compatible with all Android systems running Android 5.1 or higher. </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2"><b>Maintainability</b></h2>
          <p class="">Maintainability will require the creation of new object recognition models which may be problematic to inexperienced users or future developers. Furthermore, once the models are created, the labels for each model needs to be included in the code which may be problematic to future developers.</p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2"><b>Project management&nbsp; &nbsp;</b></h2>
          <p class="">The project got off to a poor start with little or no response from the client for the first three months, so it was frustratingly delayed in its beginning. However relations with the client drastically improved with persistent requests and staff intervention, resulting in great effort on both sides. Both the client and all members of the team took part in regular weekly contact via video conferencing and met up at least once a month to discuss aspects of the project. This had the effect of managing the progress of the apps development very well, with good communication established between the client and all members of the team, also making use of Trello to aid in the co-ordination of the project. </p>

          <p class="">There are very many improvements we would wish to add given more time: <p>
          <uL> Expanding the range of commands in voice recognition </ul>
          <ul> Improving the response rate of the app, with faster ability to switch from one text display to another more rapidly </ul>
          <ul> Increase the amount of items in the database and make it easier to add additional items </ul>
          <ul> Upgrade the hardware so we can use better and newer technologies </ul>
          <p> Mainly we wanted to integrate our app into NTT Dataâ€™s own source code: sOps as requested by the client, for which much time was spent attempting to do this, achieving the successful compiling of the code to enable this but running out of time before integration could be properly achieved. </p>
