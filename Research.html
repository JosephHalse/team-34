          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5"><b>Apps that use Object Recognition </b></h2>
          <p>There are already many different apps available which offer the user novel ways of using object recognition and/augmented reality. The most comprehensive and commonly used is “Google Lens” which allows the user to hold up their smart phone in order to identify things seen when out and about in the real world, for example, if you’re wondering what breed of dog that is in the park, or variety of flower, hold up the app and it will identify it for you. [1] It is used for many situations such as shopping, selections of food from menus and photo identification on social media. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p><b>Accessible solutions for the visually Impaired:</b>&nbsp;“Airpoly Vision” is an app designed for the partially sighted and visually impaired to be an aid to seeing, identifying and understand what is around them. By holding the mobile phone over an object it can display text to inform the user of what the object in front of them is in bold lettering, reading out text in a selected language, recognising food items, colours and natural items, capable of giving a description of the surrounding environment which can be an invaluable aid for the visually impaired. [2] </p>
          <p>“TapTapSee” is also designed as an aid for blind and partially sighted people where they hold up their smart phone and tap it to take either a still photo or video, items in which are recognised and audibly identified aloud. [3] </p>
          <p><b>Item identification for Shoppers:</b>&nbsp;Shopping aids are big business!, some of the object recognition apps designed to aid shoppers are ScreenShop [4], which identifies buyable items in photos to let the user know where they too can buy the same or similar fashion and accessory items. “CamFind” calls itself “The world’s most accurate mobile visual search engine” [5] The user takes a photo of any item they’re interested in, which is identified and suggestions of where to buy similar items are generated. “Flow Powered by Amazon” identifies millions of commercially packaged items from boxes of cereals to book covers, CDs and DVDs, can decode bar codes and QR codes, scan business cards etc. [6] </p>
          <p><b>Nature Identification:</b>&nbsp;The old days of going around the countryside or park with your little “Observers Book of Wild Flowers”, or “Trees” etc is now redundant with object recognition technology used in “electronic field guides” and apps like “Leafsnap” which allows the user to take a photograph of any flower or natural object for instant identification. [7] </p>
          <p><b>Food:</b>&nbsp;People are increasingly interested in food, healthy eating and sharing details of what they eat on social media! Apps such as “CalorieMama” identify photographed food dishes and estimate their calorific value and nutritional properties by utilizing a nutrition database. [8] </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2"><b>Apps Designed for Medical Use </b></h2>
          <p>Medical apps for the monitoring of health such as fitness testers have really taken off but there are few things on the market that perform the kind of basic medical equipment reference work that our app is meant to give. [10] Some referencing apps for use by doctors and nurses exist such as “Epocrates” for various uses such as looking up drug information and interactions, calculating BMI etc. It does not include use of object recognition or AR, the pill identifier feature relies on manual input of the pills features and printed codes. [11] “PEPID” is a symptom checker and diagnostic tool relying on a large database of information including reference diagrams and videos, via the cloud. [12] “UpToDate” is another medical reference app for mobile phones. [13] </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2"><b>Conclusion </b></h2>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Though very many apps make use of object recognition, we don’t know of any that are specifically for medical object use, like ours. Several widely used apps are for professional medical reference purposes, but we don’t know of any that make use of inbuilt camera, object recognition and AR as ours does. </p>

              <p class="">&nbsp;In theory the app could work on any android device such as a smart phone. The brief the client gave us specifically stated that it should be for the Epson Smart Glasses, so we favoured this as the final device that it should be designed for use on. In the situation described where the user is administering to a patient and using a perhaps unfamiliar piece of medical technology, it would be smoother for them to use something which enables a clear view of what's seen in-front of them, as well as the information related to the device. If using a handheld device like a smart phone they would have to keep looking away to read the information. By using the glasses the text would be clearly displayed in-front of them, merged with a real life view. This way it’s more of a true augmented reality and fulfils the need to be user friendly and innovative.&nbsp;<br>Use of the smart glasses is a convenient way of interfacing with the app, leaving the user hands free to work.</p>

          <p> At first, we downloaded Epson Moverio Software Development Kit (SDK) which is designed for use with this specific model of smart glasses, gaining access to the beta version which is available for developers via the Epson website. However we quickly realized the limitations of the SDK would not allow us to fulfill our clients requirements. This was because there was a limit of 5 custom models allowed and the ability to only recognize one model at a time, which you needed to select beforehand. Therefore we initially proceeded to use TensorFlow, however we encountered problems with it as the demo performed far too slowly on the hardware making it almost unusable. We were also unable to compile the code using API 22 and therefore couldn't modify the code. We tested the android version of Tensorflow (lite) on the glasses, having seen it perform well on a smart phone, but again ran into the same problem as the glasses have a low specification compared to a high end android phone for which TensorFlow is intended. After attempting to depreciate the version required, we decided to look for other options and stumbled across Fritz which was an API for tensorflow. Fritz worked well on our device and was able to perform all of our clients requiements quickly and thus we decided to use it in our final product.[17]</p>
