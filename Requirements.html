          <p class="mb-0 text-dark" style="">Voice recognition has become an increasingly popular concept in recent years. in Being hands-free and able to use voice commands in throughout an AR application is great productivity benefits and experience. By making use of the IBM Watson Speech-to-Text API [4], we are able to precisely transcribe human’s phrases, which enable users to control the app with voice instead of using hands or external controller to click buttons. In our project, users are able to skip from ‘the welcome page’ to ‘the object detecting page’ if the voice recogniser detects the word ‘next’ in a speech. Moreover, users can pull instruction for the corresponding detected object, which delivers a good user experience and speeds up the process of doing tasks.&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="mb-0 text-dark">Object recognition is a must-have feature for our app. By using a well-known open-source software library called Tensorflow Lite [5], we are able to achieve the above feature even with our custom models. It is a lightweight and ideal solution for mobile or embedded device, in our case, the Epson Smart Glasses. However, training a Tensorflow model can really take a long time if starting from scratch. Luckily, we made use of Transfer Learning which is a process of retraining an existing pretrained model and produce a new model [6]. By figuring out the appropriate pretrained model and training parameters and simply running a training script and an optimization script, we can get the model file in 30 minutes. We later had a lot of testing with the models, it really demonstrates the performance in a way that is fast and accurate.&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="mb-0">Liaising with our contact at NTT Data we gathered information about what was required of the app. For our example case, we were advised to speak to staff at GOSH in order to get an idea of the specific types of medical equipment for which to program the app to recognise and respond to. We contacted Dr Richard Issitt who co-ordinated the GOSH Drive programme in liaison with UCL, who kindly allowed us to see and photograph some sample items of medical equipment from a store cupboard at Great Ormond Street, advising us as to what they were used for (these were an enteral nutrition pump, suction pump for excretions and a patient monitor). We also acquired a selection of common medical equipment ourselves with which to use as samples to test the method of creating 3D models in order to teach the app to recognise them and have them at hand for testing purposes. We also ended up purchasing a pair of Epson Moverio Smart Glasses as none were available on loan from UCL.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="mb-0">We carried out research interviewing potential users to gain feedback about ease of use, the appearance of the user interface and general ideas about how the app should look and operate on the glasses. We used techniques such as one to one conversation and responses to questionnaires showing mock ups of screen shots. This gave us a good idea of what we should be aiming for in our design. Then later Alpha testing with volunteers who had a go with the app on the glasses and gave us their feedback regarding usability. We also researched into the other similar applications that are available.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">We looked into the use of TensorFlow, Android Studio, the Epsom Moverio SDK and Photogrammetry (which we used for the first working prototype) and other development tools until settling on the use of Fritz to create the final prototype. We also used TensorFlow to build the models for object recognition.</p>

            <h2 class="text-dark"><b>Use Cases: Considered</b></h2>
            <p class="mb-0 pb-2">Here are details of some of the use cases features we considered: </p>
            <p class="mb-0 pb-2"><b>Visual Selection of desired medical item to be found and identified</b>: This feature could work as an aid to helping the user recognise certain specialist medical equipment. A small picture of the item in question could be selected and appear in the corner of the screen, highlighted so the user can easily understand what it looks like without any further specialist knowledge. The item is then searched for and identified, easy for the viewer/wearer to see that it is the same item as depicted. The user can switch to another picture of other items in the database of those stored and capable of being identified. This feature was implemented in the first prototype and worked well, but it was felt to be fairly redundant and unnecessary, creating a more cluttered view. </p>
            <p class="mb-0"><b>A Scrolling Menu of Key Points Related to the Object</b>: Upon identification of an object, further information stored in the database about that item could be accessed via a scrolling menu, to be operated by the hand held controller. Again this seemed like an unnecessary further complication and proved not to be very user friendly, so the idea was put on hold, with possible future consideration in a more simplified form.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2 class="text-dark"><b>Use Case: Implemented</b></h2>
            <p class="mb-0 pb-2">Our brief for the app was quite specific, we needed to produce an app that fulfilled the project brief with little room for choice and needed to include the following essential features. </p>
            <p class="mb-0 pb-2"><b>Real time object recognition:</b> The user by wearing the glasses can identify a variety of items both general and, as requested, of a medical nature to aid in the understanding, identification and use of that item. To fulfil the brief that it must be geared towards medical items we purchased a number of sample pieces of commonly used equipment: a blood pressure monitor, a pulse oximeter/blood oxygen meter, infrared thermometer and an otoscope (for ear examinations). These were handy to have at hand to train the prototypes to recognise and use as test objects. We also felt we needed more specialist equipment so visited Great Ormond Street Hospital where we were given access to photograph an enteral nutrition pump,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="mb-0 pb-2"><b>Access to information to help the user with operation of the item</b>: We incorporated a way to access PDF files via the cloud that can be viewed on the glasses screen.</p>
            <p class="mb-0 pb-2"><b>Android compatibility:</b> The client was keen for us to make sure the app could also be used on an android enabled smart phone as well as the Epson Moverio smart glasses for which it is designed. This is both convenient and flexible for the user, who, with or without access to a pair of Epson Smart Glasses (which are very expensive, we know because we ended up buying our own also!) can still use the app with most ordinary smart phones by simply holding up the phone to the objects where the built in camera will detect the objects and text labelling it will be displayed on the phone screen on exactly the same way as it is on the smart glasses screen. Of course this method of using the app on a smart phone will result in losing one of the main key features: “hands free” but still needed to be included in our solution to provide the extra option of multi devise flexibility.</p>
