          <p class="mb-0 text-dark">Augmented Reality or AR is a technology that superimposes computer generated graphics into a view of the real world. This can have the effect of making the graphics look like part of the natural environment, augmentations to reality, as if they are really there. These can be viewed through a screen, such as the popular game “Pokemon Go” </p>
          <p class="mb-0 text-dark">where a camera takes real time images of the world and displays on top of this characters and/or text that blend in and look, when viewed on the screen like they are really there, a part of the scene in front of the camera. AR applications for use with devises like tablet computers and smart phones are becoming popular for purposes of education, easy access to information or just for fun and entertainment, bringing a new realistic dimension alive for the user who can enjoy a more immersive, hands-on experience to interact with. Holding up a smart phone with an AR app can reveal all kinds of useful hidden information about the real world environment such as shop opening hours, bus timetables and nearby places of interest. The possibilities are endless!</p>

          <p class="mb-0 text-dark">The images can also be viewed on smart glasses: the user wears the glasses and the computer generated images and text, are projected directly onto the glasses, so as to be clearly visible, and superimposed on top of their actual view of the world in front of them! This gives the impression of having a large transparent screen approximately 2 metres in front of you! This technology can be put to all kinds of uses to display information, facts, figures or images. This can become an invaluable tool for all kinds of trainees and professionals, replacing the need to stop work and consult books, the information needed can be instantly brought up before their eyes whilst they work. There are many fun and entertaining possibilities too where AR in smart glasses can inform as well as entertain, enhancing children’s educational experiences such as bringing history to life around them.</p>

              <p class="mb-0 text-dark">Techniques of deep learning and machine learning are used to train a program to identify objects. For this project we used the technique of making a 3D model with photogrammetry, then tracking it in 3d space using the inbuilt camera on the smart glass. </p>

This will enable a technician to access all the information they need, hands free while working, by looking at text displayed on the glasses screen where it is needed and easiest to reach. Gone are the old days of having to put down what you’re doing and consult an old fashioned printed manual! It can all be to be brought up instantly right in front of your eyes!

While we are waiting for the response we acquired a selection of common medical equipment with which to use as samples to test the method of creating 3D models to teach the app to recognise. We also ended up purchasing a pair of Epson Moverio Smart Glasses as none were available on loan from UCL.&nbsp;<br><br>We carried out research interviewing potential users to gain feedback about ease of use, the appearance of the user interface and general ideas about how the app should look and operate on the glasses, using one to one conversation and responses to questionnaires showing mock ups of screen shots. This gave us a good idea of what we should be aiming for in our design. We researched into the other similar applications that are available.<br>&nbsp;<br>We looked into the use of TensorFlow, Android Studio, the Epsom Moverio SDK and Photogrammetry.</p>
