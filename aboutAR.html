          <p class="lead mb-0">Augmented Reality or AR is a technology that superimposes computer generated graphics into a view of the real world. This can have the effect of making the graphics look like part of the natural environment, augmentations to reality, as if they are really there. These can be viewed through a screen, such as the popular game “Pokemon Go” </p><img class="img-fluid d-block" src="ar9.jpg">
          <p class="lead mb-0">where a camera takes real time images of the world and displays on top of this characters and/or text that blend in and look, when viewed on the screen like they are really there, a part of the scene in front of the camera. AR applications for use with devises like tablet computers and smart phones are becoming popular for purposes of education, easy access to information or just for fun and entertainment, bringing a new realistic dimension alive for the user who can enjoy a more immersive, hands-on experience to interact with. Holding up a smart phone with an AR app can reveal all kinds of useful hidden information about the real world environment such as shop opening hours, bus timetables and nearby places of interest. The possibilities are endless!</p>

          <p class="lead mb-0">The images can also be viewed on smart glasses: the user wears the glasses and the computer generated images and text, are projected directly onto the glasses, so as to be clearly visible, and superimposed on top of their actual view of the world in front of them! This gives the impression of having a large transparent screen approximately 2 metres in front of you! This technology can be put to all kinds of uses to display information, facts, figures or images. This can become an invaluable tool for all kinds of trainees and professionals, replacing the need to stop work and consult books, the information needed can be instantly brought up before their eyes whilst they work. There are many fun and entertaining possibilities too where AR in smart glasses can inform as well as entertain, enhancing children’s educational experiences such as bringing history to life around them.</p>
