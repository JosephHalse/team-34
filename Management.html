          <p class="text-dark lead text-center">With any new devise or application it’s important to consider the legal issues that may be involved.</p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2 text-dark"><b>Liability</b></h2>
          <p class="text-dark">As our application is designed to be used by medical professionals, any inaccuracies or malfunctions in its performance could potentially affect a patient and thus make it of consideration in a medical liability case. The expanding use of technology in medicine brings up new legal challenges. George Buttigieg, senior lecturer at the faculty of medicine and surgery at the University of Malta, Hungary, considers it an urgent need to consider the “increasing complexity of medical technology playing major roles in diagnosis and treatment, increasing the window of potential malpractice and liability” [1]. Clearly as more technological tools are developed for use in medicine the need to consider their liable implications will expand.</p>
          <p class="text-dark">It’s difficult to imagine what may go wrong with any medic using a devise designed to identify equipment and display information by way of PDF documents, which would hardly be blamed for any mistakes the doctor could make if they were accessed in the traditional way on paper, rather than on a smart glasses screen or android screen. Our app is not involved with diagnosis and any mistakes, delays or flaws in its operation should not be endangering to the health of the patient. It’s still important to consider anything that could potentially be blamed on the technology. It’s possible that patients may not like being treated by a medic who wears a pair of smart glasses, resulting in a loss of confidence in the medic, a disconnect between health provider and patient, resulting in the impersonalisation. It’s very unlikely but should be considered that a patient may complain of not satisfied with treatment and think the medic incompetent or lacking knowledge due to their usage of the smart glasses. It’s a matter for debate whether the makers of the app would incur any blame, more realistic to imagine the medic and whatever inappropriate manner they displayed to the patient would be at fault. Again another unlikely scenario that might be worth considering is in the situation that a misdiagnosis arose and mistakes affecting the outcome for the patient’s health, after the use of the app, the health worker might be tempted to blame the app for inaccuracy and the makers of the app held responsible. </p>
          <p class="text-dark">New technologies, especially those that utilize machine learning (like our app) have not been in commercial use for long so legally it is a new grey area. by Johan Ordish who explains in his paper that clinicians are currently the primary defendants in actions for clinical negligence, liable for any software malfunctions that contribute to inaccurate diagnosis, but now the increasing use of machine learning may challenge this legal position, whether or not machine learning satisfies the definition of a product, resulting in the idea that the current approach to clinical liability should be reconsidered. [2] </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2 text-dark"><b>Intellectual Property</b></h2>
          <p class="text-dark">“Intellectual Property” is the term used for the legal rights that protect creative works. </p>
          <p class="text-dark">The idea of “copyright” as a legal form of protection against people passing off work as their own is long established. Since the international agreement, the Berne Convention, which was agreed to in Switzerland in 1886, all literary and artistic material is copyrighted automatically at the point of creation. This grants the creator of an original work exclusive right to their own material. Since the onset of the digital age, new definitions needed to be established to encompass the authorship of software, computer programs and the like, which present new problems as illicit copying and piracy had now become very easy and potentially hard to detect. The UK “Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988 was extended in 1992 to include computer programs. </p>
          <p class="text-dark">The UK “Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988 was extended in 1992 to include computer programs. In 1996 the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) draw up the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) which is concerned with the rights of authorship of digital works, according to this original computer programs are treated as literary work, therefore protected by copyright. [3] </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2 text-dark"><b>Non-Disclosure Agreement</b></h2>
          <p class="text-dark">We have been given access to work with a source code for an existing application, sOps, which is legally protected as confidential property of the client, NTT Data. This will be treated as confidential business information (a “trade secret”) protected by the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), as it fulfils the requirements of 1): being secret information, 2): of commercial value and 3): measures have been taken to keep it confidential. [4] </p>
          <p class="text-dark">In order to access this code legally with the permission of its owners and to guarantee that we will treat it in the strictest confidence we need to enter into a non-disclosure agreement. When signed by both parties, the owners of the intellectual property (NTT Data) and ourselves on behalf of our university (UCL), we agree to abide by keeping the trade secret, as an authorised disclose of IP, enabling us to access it for the purpose and duration of completing this project. </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2 text-dark"><b>Open Source Materials&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h2>
          <p class="text-dark">Open source software (OSS) is that which a user can gain access to its source code and share it legally. For this we have made use of such opens source material as TensorFlow and Fritz. </p>
          <h2 class="mb-7 display-5 pt-2 text-dark"><b>Data Privacy</b></h2>
          <p class="text-dark">The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the law that came into place in May 2018 to protect the privacy of all personal data. [5] As our app does not deal with any personal data, it does not store any data on a patient or generate any, this issue is not relevant to its use. </p>
